      "Today websites are not just used to provide information to people, but\n",
      "they are also used to provide information to large language models. For\n",
      "instance, language models are often used to enhance development\n",
      "environments used by coders, with many systems including an option to\n",
      "ingest information about programming libraries and APIs from website\n",
      "documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing information for language models is a little different to\n",
      "providing information for humans, although there is plenty of overlap.\n",
      "Language models generally like to have information in a more concise\n",
      "form. This can be more similar to what a human expert would want to\n",
      "read. Language models can ingest a lot of information quickly, so it can\n",
      "be helpful to have a single place where all of the key information can\n",
      "be collated—not for training (since training generally involved scraping\n",
      "all pages in all readable formats), but for helping users accessing the\n",
      "site via AI helpers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context windows are too small to handle most websites in their entirety,\n",
      "and converting HTML pages with complex navigation, ads, Javascript, etc\n",
      "into LLM-friendly plain text documents is difficult and imprecise.\n",
      "Therefore it would be helpful if there was a way to identify the most\n",
      "important information to provide to AI helpers, in the most appropriate\n",

      "[llms-txt](./intro.html) project providing a CLI and Python module for\n",

      "information sources. Information about new legislation and necessary\n",

      "\n",
      "The `llms.txt` file is unusual in that it uses Markdown to structure the\n",
      "information rather than a classic structured format such as XML. The\n",
      "reason for this is that we expect many of these files to be read by\n",
      "language models and agents. Having said that, the information in\n",
      "`llms.txt` follows a specific format and can be read using standard\n",
      "programmatic-based tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `llms.txt` file spec is for files located in the root path\n",
      "`/llms.txt` of a website (or, optionally, in a subpath). A file\n",
      "following the spec contains the following sections as markdown, in the\n",

      "- An H1 with the name of the project or site. This is the only required\n",
      "  section\n",
      "- A blockquote with a short summary of the project, containing key\n",
      "  information necessary for understanding the rest of the file\n",
      "- Zero or more markdown sections (e.g. paragraphs, lists, etc) of any\n",

      "# L402: The Missing Piece in the Internet’s Payment Infrastructure\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Designed for a world where AI and automation are essential, L402 enables seamless, machine-friendly transactions that traditional, human-centric payment flows can’t support.**\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Features\n",
      "\n",
      "L402 simplifies and automates the process of handling payments on the internet, allowing seamless integration into digital workflows. It leverages HTTP as a foundation to standardize how payments are requested and processed, making it easier for AI agents and automated systems to interact with services.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "- **HTTP-based flow**: simplifies payment handling by using HTTP 402 status codes and JSON payloads, allowing clients to request resources, pay and access them seamlessly.\n",
      "- **Standarize payment requests**: services indicate payment requirements, making integration predictable and easier for developers to implement across different systems.\n",
      "-  **Payment agnostic**: works with a variety of payment solutions, from services like Stripe to cryptocurrencies, offering developers the flexibility to use the payment network that best fits their needs.\n",
      "- **Designed for automation**: enables seamless, autonomous transactions between services and AI agents, removing the need for human intervention in payment processes.\n",
      "- **Extensible and open source**: built to be open and adaptable, making it easy to extend and integrate with future payment solutions and evolving technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "*L402 makes payments a core part of HTTP interactions by leveraging the HTTP 402 status code*\n",
      "\n",
      "Payments were largely an afterthought in the internet’s original design, even though the HTTP protocol reserved the 402 “Payment Required” status code for future use. Instead, payment solutions evolved around human-centric processes and relied on networks like Visa and Mastercard, making manual checkout flows the standard. This worked well for traditional web interactions, where payments were either preconfigured or managed manually by users.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the rise of autonomous systems and AI agents that discover and interact with services independently, the limitations of these human-centric payment flows are becoming clear. These agents interact primarily through APIs and bypass browser-based interfaces, revealing a need for a payment model that supports automated, real-time transactions without human setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "L402 addresses this gap by making payments “machine-friendly” on the internet. Leveraging HTTP’s 402 status code and JSON payloads, L402 standardizes how services request payments directly within HTTP interactions, enabling AI agents and automated systems to handle payments as naturally as data exchange. This transforms payments into a core, automated component of the web.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Protocol\n",
      "\n",
      "This sequence diagram illustrates how the L402 protocol streamlines the process of handling payments for HTTP resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "![L402 Protocol Flow](l402-protocol-flow.svg)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The interaction begins when a client requests access to a resource and the server checks if payment is needed. If payment is required, the server responds with details, allowing the client to complete the transaction. After verifying the payment, the server grants access to the resource. This workflow enables automated and seamless payment interactions over HTTP.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial Discovery (Step 1)**\n",
      "   - Client requests access to an HTTP resource\n",
      "   - Server responds with HTTP 402 and offer details\n",
      "   - Response includes details about each one of the available offers, a `payment_request_url` and payment methods for each offer\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Payment Processing (Step 2)**\n",
      "   - Client selects an offer and payment method\n",
      "   - Client requests specific payment details via `payment_request_url`\n",
      "   - Server generates and returns payment-specific details\n",
      "   - Client completes payment using the provided details\n",
      "   - Client re-requests the resource with proof of payment\n",
      "   - Server verifies and serves the requested resource\n",
      "\n",
      "### Payment Types\n",
      "\n",
      "L402 supports three primary payment types, each designed for different use cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **One-time Payments**\n",
      "   - Simplest form of payment for single-use access\n",
      "   - Ideal for: e-commerce transactions, individual content access, pay-per-view content, or one-off API calls\n",
      "   - No additional required fields\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Subscription Payments**\n",
      "   - Enables recurring access for a specified duration\n",
      "   - Required field: `duration` (examples: &quot;1 month&quot;, &quot;1 year&quot;, &quot;30 days&quot;)\n",
      "   - Best suited for: SaaS products, membership services, content platforms, or recurring API access\n",
      "   - Allows services to provide sustained access without repeated payments\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Top-up Payments**\n",
      "   - Preload a balance for future use\n",
      "   - Required field: `balance` (numerical value representing available credits/tokens)\n",
      "   - Perfect for: API usage credits, digital wallet systems, prepaid services\n",
      "   - Enables micro-transactions without repeated payment overhead\n",
      "\n",
      "Example usage scenarios:\n",
      "- An flight/hotel provider might use **one-time** payments for a given trip.\n",
      "- A SaaS platform could use **subscriptions** for ongoing access to its API.\n",
      "- A developer platform might implement **top-up** payments where users pre-purchase API credits.\n",

      "\n",
      "A demonstration of how to build AI-agent friendly paid APIs using the [L402 protocol](https://github.com/l402-protocol/l402 \n",
      "). \n",
      "\n",
      "This service provides stock market data with automated payment processing, specifically designed for AI agents to consume programmatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Live demo: https://stock.l402.org\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why L402 for AI Agents?\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional payment flows are designed for human interaction, requiring manual setup and browser-based interfaces. This project demonstrates how L402 protocol enables:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Automated Discovery &amp; Payments**: AI agents can understand payment requirements, and process transactions autonomously\n",
      "- **Programmatic Access**: Clean API interface designed for machine consumption\n",
      "- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Support for Lightning Network, Stripe, and Coinbase, allowing AI agents to use their preferred payment network\n",
      "- **Flexible Pricing**: From credit systems to subscriptions the L402  allows fine-grained control over API access\n",
      "\n",
      "## Payment Providers\n",
      "\n",
      "The L402 protocol is payment-provider-agnostic and can integrate with any payment system. This demo implements three payment methods to showcase different approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Stripe (Credit Cards)\n",
      "- Uses Stripe Payment Links for seamless credit card processing\n",
      "- Compatible with AI agents using the latest Stripe libraries\n",
      "- Direct integration via [Stripe&#x27;s AI-agent workflows](https://stripe.dev/blog/adding-payments-to-your-agentic-workflows)\n",
      "- Enables traditional payment methods (credit/debit cards) for AI agents\n",
      "\n",
      "### Lightning Network (via Lightspark)\n",
      "- Leverages Lightning Network for instant, low-cost payments\n",
      "- Real-time settlement with minimal fees\n",
      "- Highly interoperable and secure transaction processing\n",
      "- Ideal for micropayments and programmatic access\n",
      "\n",
      "### Coinbase Commerce (Crypto)\n",
      "- Supports multiple blockchain networks:\n",
      "  - Ethereum\n",
      "  - Polygon\n",
      "  - Base\n",
      "- Provides hosted checkout information\n",
      "- Returns contract addresses for direct blockchain interaction\n",
      "- Direct integration with [Coinbase AgentKit](https://www.coinbase.com/en-ca/developer-platform/discover/launches/introducing-agentkit) for AI-native crypto payments\n",
      "- Enables crypto-native payment flows\n",

      "instance, language models are often used to enhance development\n",
      "environments used by coders, with many systems including an option to\n",
      "ingest information about programming libraries and APIs from website\n",
      "documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing information for language models is a little different to\n",
      "providing information for humans, although there is plenty of overlap.\n",
      "Language models generally like to have information in a more concise\n",
      "form. This can be more similar to what a human expert would want to\n",
      "read. Language models can ingest a lot of information quickly, so it can\n",
      "be helpful to have a single place where all of the key information can\n",
      "be collated—not for training (since training generally involved scraping\n",
      "all pages in all readable formats), but for helping users accessing the\n",
      "site via AI helpers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context windows are too small to handle most websites in their entirety,\n",
      "and converting HTML pages with complex navigation, ads, Javascript, etc\n",
      "into LLM-friendly plain text documents is difficult and imprecise.\n",
      "Therefore it would be helpful if there was a way to identify the most\n",
      "important information to provide to AI helpers, in the most appropriate\n",

      "At the moment the most widely and easily understood format for language\n",

      "\n",
      "The `llms.txt` file is unusual in that it uses Markdown to structure the\n",
      "information rather than a classic structured format such as XML. The\n",
      "reason for this is that we expect many of these files to be read by\n",
      "language models and agents. Having said that, the information in\n",
      "`llms.txt` follows a specific format and can be read using standard\n",
      "programmatic-based tools.\n",
      "\n",

      "`/llms.txt` of a website (or, optionally, in a subpath). A file\n",

      "- An H1 with the name of the project or site. This is the only required\n",

      "- A blockquote with a short summary of the project, containing key\n",

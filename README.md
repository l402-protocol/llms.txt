# L402 Protocol llms.txt

This repository provides the `l402-llms.txt` file - an [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/) implementation for the L402 protocol.

## Usage

Download and use the `l402-llms.txt` file to help LLMs interact with L402-enabled services. Place it at the root of your service (typically at `/llms.txt`) to enable AI assistants to understand your service's L402 payment requirements.
